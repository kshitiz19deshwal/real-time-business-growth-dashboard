## 🎯 Business Objective

The objective of this project is to build a **real-time business intelligence system** that enables decision-makers to:

- Monitor overall business performance in near real time  
- Track revenue growth and volatility trends  
- Identify demand–revenue mismatches early  
- Enable faster, data-driven business decisions  

The dashboard is designed for **executives, product managers, and business teams** to quickly assess growth health and risk signals.

## 📌 Key Business KPIs Defined

The following KPIs are explicitly tracked and monitored:

- **Total Revenue** – Overall business revenue generated  
- **Average Hourly Revenue** – Revenue velocity over time  
- **Average Price** – Pricing stability indicator  
- **Total Transactions** – Business activity volume  
- **Revenue Growth (%)** – Growth momentum indicator  
- **Price Volatility** – Risk and instability signal  
- **Demand vs Revenue Trend** – Market alignment indicator

## 📊 Business-Focused Visualizations

The dashboard includes the following **business-driven visualizations**:

1. **Executive KPI Summary** – Snapshot of overall business health  
2. **Revenue Growth Over Time** – Identifies growth acceleration or slowdown  
3. **Price Volatility Trend** – Highlights periods of business risk  
4. **Demand vs Revenue Alignment** – Evaluates conversion and pricing efficiency  

Each visualization is designed to directly support **business monitoring and decision-making**, not just exploratory analysis.
